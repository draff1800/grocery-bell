## Mobile App
### Name:

	need to next shop. Intended to save you from unexpected missing ingredients
    when preparing lunch or dinner.
### MVP: 
	1) Input, save, edit and view stock of groceries via basic form interface.
	2) Take photo of Sainsbury's receipt to update stock 
	   (Only needs to cover the items I buy right now).
	3) Input, save and edit eating plan via basic form interface 
	   (Assume plan will be adhered to each day).
	4) For each ingredient in stock, view a bar chart to show when it will 
	   run out.
	5) App will mark ingredients that are 24, 48 and 72 hours from running out, 
	   as well as those already run out.
	6) Each day, app will detect all ingredients due to expire the next day, 
	   or already expired, and push a shopping reminder notification.
	7) Clicking the notification will bring user to existing stock screen.
